_We will be very grateful, if your problem was described as completely as possible,
enclosing excerpts from logs (if possible within DEBUG mode, if no errors evident
within INFO mode), and configuration in particular of effected relevant settings
(e.g., with ` fail2ban-client -d | grep 'affected-jail-name' ` for a particular
jail troubleshooting).
Thank you in advance for the details, because such issues like "It does not work" 
alone could not help to resolve anything!
Thanks! (remove this paragraph and other comments upon reading)_
